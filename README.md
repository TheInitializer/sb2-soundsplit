# sb2-soundsplit
splits your sound into little chunks and puts them in a big scratch project so you can make a music player or something for whatever reason

idk I was bored

I couldn't think of a better name

## requirements
 - python 2 (not 3 because kurt only supports 2)
 - kurt
 - pydub
 
## usage
```
python soundsplit.py <path to audio file (wav)> <time in ms for each chunk>
```
(I found 500ms works best)

## enjoy
